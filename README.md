# Polymer demo

**Please note:** this is based on Polymer 1.0, and will be gradually updated to 2.0 once it is released properly.

This repo demonstrates the creation and usage of basic Polymer Elements.


## Getting started

Install the Polymer CLI:

	npm install -g polymer-cli

This can take a while because it has many dependencies and installs Selenium.

From the repo folder, start the Polymer server:

	polymer serve

Then visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
